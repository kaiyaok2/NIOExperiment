You can fix the test by defining a new id for the state machine in each test run. You can achieve this by appending a timestamp to the state machine id. Here is the revised code:

```java
public class StateMachinePlantUMLTest {
    // ... other code ...
    
    @Test
    public void testPlantUML(){
        // ... other code ...
        
        // Add a timestamp to the state machine id
        String stateMachineId = "AdjustPriceTask" + System.currentTimeMillis();
        StateMachine stateMachine = builder.build(stateMachineId);
        
        // ... other code ...
    }
    
    // ... other code ...
}
```

This will ensure that every state machine built in each test run has a unique id, preventing conflict with previous test runs.
