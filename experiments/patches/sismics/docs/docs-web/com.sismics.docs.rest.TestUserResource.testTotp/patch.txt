The error message shows that there is a HTTP 400 Bad Request error on creating the user. This usually occurs if the user already exists in the database. 

To fix this issue, you may consider adding a method to delete the user before the test runs. Here is a sample code:

```java
public class TestUserResource extends BaseJerseyTest {
    /**
     * Clean up the test environment (remove users).
     */
    @Before
    public void deleteUsers() {
        // Login admin
        String adminToken = adminToken();
        // Delete totp1 user
        Response response = target().path("/user/totp1").request()
                .cookie(TokenBasedSecurityFilter.COOKIE_NAME, adminToken)
                .delete();
        // Check that the user was deleted
        Assert.assertEquals(200, response.getStatus());
    }

    /**
     * Test the user resource admin functions.
     */
    @Test
    public void testTotp() {
        // Your test code...
    }
}
```

Please note that the HTTP status code 200 is used to confirm that the user was deleted successfully. You may need to adjust this according to your API's specifications. 

Also, please note that the `deleteUsers` method uses the `@Before` annotation which means it will be executed before each test method is run. This is to ensure that the test environment is clean before each test, not just the first one.
