Adding 'kc.dispose()' at the end of the test function:

```java
    @Test
    public void testRulesAndProcesses() throws Exception {
        // ... existing test code ...

        kc.dispose();
    }
```
This will dispose of the KieContainer at the end of each test run, clearing up the shared state and allowing for subsequent test runs in the same JVM to succeed.
