You can fix this issue by making each test run use a unique class name. You can achieve that by appending a random UUID to the class name. Here is the modified code:

```java
@Test
void test() throws Exception {
    ClassGenerator cg = ClassGenerator.newInstance();
    // add className, interface, superClass
    String className = BaseClass.class.getPackage().getName() + ".TestClass" + UUID.randomUUID().toString().replace("-", "");
    cg.setClassName(className);
    // rest of your code remains the same
}
```

This way, every time the test runs, it generates a unique class name, which should prevent the test from failing in the subsequent runs.
