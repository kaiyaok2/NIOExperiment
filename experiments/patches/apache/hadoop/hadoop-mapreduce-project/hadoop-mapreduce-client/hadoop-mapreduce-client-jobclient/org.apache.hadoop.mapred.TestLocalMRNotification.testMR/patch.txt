You can reset the counters by adding these lines in your tearDown method after stopHttpServer():
```
NotificationServlet.counter = 0;
NotificationServlet.failureCounter = 0;
```
So your tearDown method should look like this:

```java
@After
public void tearDown() throws Exception {
  stopHttpServer();
  NotificationServlet.counter = 0;
  NotificationServlet.failureCounter = 0;
  super.tearDown();
}
```
This will reset the counters before each test execution, preventing any side effects from previous tests.
